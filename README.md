SEPA sprint 2: Project 2 (Doctor Booking System (Afya App)

## Decription
From time to time, patients usually require specialized treatment in cities such as Nairobi. You can either visit the doctor's office to get an appointment or make a phone call. We want to simplify the process by allowing patients to see a list of doctors in a certain city and book an appointment with them.

We want to build a web application called Afya (you can also give it another name). The admin should be able to create user accounts for doctors and then doctors can login and create their schedule. A patient first needs to create a user account before being able to book a doctor. You can also explore options for doctors to create their own accounts but these accounts should be verified by the admin first before they appear for patients to book.

So there are 3 user levels, administrator, doctor and patient. When a patient books an appointment with a certain specialist, they get an automated email. When a doctor logs into the system, they should see a list of patients that have booked their services and the appointment times.
