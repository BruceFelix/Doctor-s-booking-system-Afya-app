# MEDIC BOOKING APP

Medic booking app is a web application that simplyfies the process of booking for doctor's appointments by eliminating the process of visiting the doctor's office or by making a phone call. A patient gets the opportunity to schedule an appointment through the application based on a doctor's availability and the county they are located.
